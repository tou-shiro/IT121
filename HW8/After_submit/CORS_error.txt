i tried to divided JavaScript file to module.  But I got access to script "file://.............../imageObjects.js" from origin "null" has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: htttp, data, isolated-app, chrome-extension, chrome, https, chrome-untrusted.

The error message you're encountering is related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to a different origin than the one from which the web page was served, unless the server explicitly allows such requests.

The error you're seeing ("Access to script file://... from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy") typically occurs when you're trying to load a script file using the file:// protocol (local file system) in your JavaScript code, and it's being restricted due to CORS policies.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

Use a Local Server: Instead of directly opening the HTML file in your browser (using file:// protocol), set up a local server to serve your files. You can use tools like Node.js with Express or Python's built-in http.server to create a local server. Access your HTML file through http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1.

Modify Browser Security Settings: Some browsers might allow you to disable CORS restrictions for local file access during development. However, this isn't recommended for production environments, and the method varies depending on the browser. For example, in Chrome, you might start it with the --allow-file-access-from-files flag, but it's not advised for general use.

Serve Files via a Supported Protocol: Instead of accessing files via the file:// protocol, host your files on a server that uses http:// or https:// protocols. You can use services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or even a local server as mentioned in option 1.

Consider Module Bundlers: If you're using modules in JavaScript (e.g., ES6 modules), consider using a module bundler like Webpack, Parcel, or Rollup. These tools can help manage your modules and bundle them into a single file that can be loaded without CORS issues.

By using one of these approaches, you should be able to resolve the CORS-related issue you're facing when trying to access local files in your JavaScript code.
